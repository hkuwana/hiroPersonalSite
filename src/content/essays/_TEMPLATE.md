ESSAY WRITING TEMPLATE
======================
How to use this:
1. Copy this file and rename it (kebab-case, e.g., my-new-essay.md)
2. Fill in the frontmatter (title, date as YYYY-MM-DD, one-line description)
3. For each section below, write your raw thoughts in your own words
4. Delete the <!-- comment --> blocks as you go
5. When done, you can ask AI to: fix typos, suggest better section headers,
   or point out where the structure could be tighter
6. DO NOT ask AI to rewrite your words — only to organize what you already wrote

The goal: YOUR words, YOUR voice, just with better structure.

<!--
HOOK — What made you start thinking about this?
Write 2-4 sentences. Be specific. What frustrated you, surprised you, or broke?
Example starter: "I've been noticing that..." or "Something has been bugging me about..."
-->



<!--
THE IDEA — What's the mental model or concept?
Explain it like you're telling a friend who's smart but not in your field.
Don't worry about being precise — just get the idea down.
Example starter: "What if we thought about it as..." or "The way I see it..."
-->

## [your section title]



<!--
THE IMPLICATION — What does this idea mean when you follow it to its logical end?
This is the "oh shit" moment. What surprised you about your own idea?
Example starter: "The thing that hit me is..." or "One thing that comes to mind immediately..."
-->

## [your section title]



<!--
YOUR SITUATION — How does this apply to what you're actually building?
Get specific. Use your real numbers, your real product, your real problems.
This is what makes it YOUR essay and not a generic blog post.
Example starter: "Right now, for my product..." or "I'm thinking about this because..."
-->

## [your section title]



<!--
THE CAVEAT — What don't you know yet? Where does this break down?
Being honest about limits makes the rest more credible.
Example starter: "In any case..." or "The honest part is..."
-->

## [your section title]



<!--
THE TAKEAWAY — One sentence on what you're actually doing differently.
Don't summarize. Just land the plane.
Example starter: "I keep coming back to..." or "The question I'm sitting with is..."
-->

## [your section title]
