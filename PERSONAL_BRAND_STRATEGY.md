# Hiro Kuwana — Personal Brand Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the personal brand strategy, content architecture, and distribution plan for Hiro Kuwana's personal site. The goal is to position Hiro as a go-to voice in **AI automation and education** — particularly for educators and non-technical people who want to become "slightly technical."

---

## Brand Identity

### Positioning Statement

> **"The Reluctant Technologist"** — A self-taught developer who automates what corporations need teams for. Weekly essays on AI, automation, and building as a solo founder. For educators and non-technical people who want to actually *use* AI, not just talk about it.

### Core Narrative

Hiro is a Japanese-American environmental engineer who taught himself to code and now builds AI products (Kaiwa) while automating workflows that used to require entire teams. He bridges two worlds:

1. **Geographic**: US and Japan tech/business cultures
2. **Technical**: Non-technical → Technical (he made the journey, now guides others)

### Unique Proof Points

- Automated 50 blog posts/day workflow
- Built automated daily update email systems
- Created mobile-to-code deployment pipeline
- Automated VC deal flow analysis (Flybyrd)
- Building Kaiwa as a solopreneur

## Content Strategy

### Rename: "Blog" → "Essays"

The site currently uses "Essays" (good). This signals intentionality and aligns with PG/Collinson energy. Keep this.

### Content Pillars (4 Categories)

#### 1. Automation Playbooks
*"How I actually did it"*

Behind-the-scenes tutorials of real automations. Include architecture, tools used, mistakes made, and results.

**Examples:**
- "How I Automated 50 Blog Posts Per Day (Full Walkthrough)"
- "My Mobile-to-Code Pipeline: Shipping From My Phone"
- "Automating VC Deal Flow: What Worked and What Didn't"

**Format:** Long-form tutorial + optional video walkthrough
**Frequency:** 1x/month
**Time investment:** 4 hours

#### 2. AI for Educators
*"Making AI practical for the classroom"*

Accessible guides for educators wanting to implement AI. Focus on practical, low-barrier implementations.

**Examples:**
- "5 Ways to Use AI in Your Classroom This Week"
- "AI Grading Assistants: A Realistic Assessment"
- "How to Teach Students to Use AI Without Losing Critical Thinking"

**Format:** Practical guide with clear steps
**Frequency:** 1x/month
**Time investment:** 3 hours

#### 3. Building Kaiwa
*"Building in public"*

Weekly-ish updates on building Kaiwa. Decisions, failures, wins, learnings. Authentic founder journey.

**Examples:**
- "Week 12: Why I Rebuilt the Onboarding (Again)"
- "What 1,000 User Conversations Taught Me About Language Learning"
- "The Feature I Almost Built That Would Have Killed Us"

**Format:** Shorter essay, journal-style
**Frequency:** 2x/month (or weekly during active periods)
**Time investment:** 1-2 hours

#### 4. Contrarian Takes
*"Essays that make you think differently"*

Longer essays challenging conventional wisdom. The Paul Graham / Veritasium-style pieces.

**Examples:**
- "The Case Against Learning to Code"
- "Why Most AI Tutorials Make You Worse at AI"
- "What America Gets Wrong About Japanese Work Culture"
- "The Automation Paradox: Why Working Less Requires Working More"

**Format:** Long-form essay (1500-3000 words)
**Frequency:** 1x/month
**Time investment:** 4 hours

### Content Calendar (Monthly)

| Week | Content Type | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Building Kaiwa (update) | 2 hrs |
| 2 | AI for Educators OR Automation Playbook | 3-4 hrs |
| 3 | Building Kaiwa (update) | 2 hrs |
| 4 | Contrarian Take (essay) | 4 hrs |

**Total: ~10-12 hours/month (2.5-3 hrs/week average)**

This is slightly above your 2-4 hr/week budget. To reduce:
- Do Building Kaiwa updates 2x/month instead of 4x
- Alternate Automation Playbooks and AI for Educators (one per month, not both)

---

## Distribution Strategy

### The Core Question

> "Should I do email newsletter, calls, or something else?"

### Recommendation: Email Newsletter (Primary) + Social Amplification

#### Why Email Newsletter?

1. **You own the audience** — Not dependent on algorithms (Twitter, LinkedIn can change anytime)
2. **Direct relationship** — Lands in inbox, high engagement rates
3. **Portable asset** — If platforms die, you keep your list
4. **Matches your cadence** — Weekly/biweekly essays fit newsletter format perfectly
5. **Compounds over time** — 100 subscribers → 1,000 → 10,000 (your "go-to guy" insurance policy)
6. **Low effort** — Essay goes on site, same content goes to newsletter

#### Newsletter Options

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Buttondown** | Simple, cheap, developer-friendly, markdown support | Less discovery | You (matches minimalist ethos) |
| **Substack** | Built-in discovery, social features | They own the relationship, less control | Maximum reach |
| **ConvertKit** | Powerful automation, landing pages | More complex, pricier | If you want to sell courses later |
| **Beehiiv** | Modern, good analytics, monetization options | Newer platform | Growth-focused creators |

**My recommendation:** **Buttondown** — It's simple, markdown-native, cheap ($9/mo for up to 1,000 subscribers), and aligns with your "build for decades" philosophy. You can always migrate later.

#### Distribution Flow

```
1. Write essay on your site (source of truth)
         ↓
2. Send to email newsletter (same content or summary + link)
         ↓
3. Post thread/summary on Twitter/X
         ↓
4. Cross-post to LinkedIn (for educator audience)
         ↓
5. Answer related questions on Quora (link back)
```

### What About Calls?

Calls (like office hours) are high-touch and valuable, but:

- **Don't scale** — 1:1 time doesn't compound
- **Better for later** — Once you have an audience, you can offer paid calls/consulting
- **Use strategically** — "Book a call" CTA on site for high-intent people (potential collaborators, press, hiring)

**Recommendation:** Keep your Cal.com link for inbound requests, but don't make calls your primary distribution. Your essays should do the work at scale.

### Platform-Specific Strategy

| Platform | What to Post | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Your Site** | Full essays (canonical source) | Weekly |
| **Email Newsletter** | Full essay or summary + link | Weekly |
| **Twitter/X** | Threads summarizing essays, quick takes, building in public updates | 3-5x/week |
| **LinkedIn** | Cross-post essays (educators are here) | 1x/week |
| **Quora** | Answer questions, link to relevant essays | As relevant |
